# Libraries
These folders hold headers and definitions to be compiled into libraries, which are then linked with the machines as they are also compiled into binary objects.

As per the instructions on the main page, start with the libs-to-build folder first as it makes the libraries and copies them and headers to needed folders, then follow rest of instructions on main page.
