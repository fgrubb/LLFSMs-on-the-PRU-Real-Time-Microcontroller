# Library Binary Folder
This folder should later contain the library binaries when make is run on the ../libs-to-build dir.
The RPMsg folder here with both the binary library, and it's source are from TI, from their PRU examples in their git.
Please look at the most upper level Readme for the link to these examples.

## Notes:
Shall we add ucFSM binaries here?  At least things would work if there is still a hassle to "open source" them.
